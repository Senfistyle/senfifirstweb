<p>We are two GCSE students with a passion for art. Thus, we decided to open a business to share our passion with you. We endeavour to create artwork for museums and customers, and eventually collaborate with town councils to incorporate our work into the environment- in order to improve the urban experience.</p>

<p><i><bold>Serenity Bowen</bold></i>, one half of the collaboration, is an artist who takes inspiration from more contemporary art styles- this influences her own artwork- giving her paintings plenty of saturated colours and clear, rigid lines.</p>

<p><i><bold>Finlay Walker</bold></i> draws in a very different way- he takes influence from realistic painters like Jean-Louis Ernest Meissonier and Eugène Delacroix. He likes to recreate this style primarily with watercolour, oil, acrylic and graphite pencil. </p>

<p>Via collaboration, we will be able to create an exciting fusion of art styles for the entire British populace.</p>
